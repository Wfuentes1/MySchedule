  <h1>
  Computing Experience
  </h1>
  <p> - I do not have much experience in computers. I have started getting that experience went I took CSCI 111 recently.
  It has been difficult to program with no previous experience but I am slowly getting used to it.
  What motivated for me to take computer science is that I see how the work advances year by year.
 I know at some point everything might become computer assisted and I wanted to be part of it to make something for the future.
 I started out as a computer engineer but from what I saw it was not something I wanted to do but computer programming was.
